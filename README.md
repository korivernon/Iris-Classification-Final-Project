2.5 Automatic iris classification

The automatic Iris classification program has been completed.

State of work:
The following functions have been completed:
1. Create Table
2. Print Range Max and Min of Feature 1 and Feature 2
3. Find Mean of Feature 1 and Feature 2
4. Find Standard Deviation of Feature 1 and Feature 2
5. Normalize Feature 1 and Feature 2
6. Make predictions for Iris species type
7. Find Euclidean distance between two points
8. Find the error between the Test data set and the Predicted data set
9. Plot the train data, test data, and predicted list
10. Plot key

Retrospective on Development Process:
I am fairly satisfied with my final product. Although my error percentage was slightly higher than I would have liked, I am proud of my final product. In the beginning I anticipated that the hardest task would be creating a function be to normalize the data, however the most challenging function was the make predictions function. This function proved to be much more difficult than the normalize data function, because it was one of the most crucial parts of the project. 

Planning out functions was difficult for me initially, as well as figuring out how the functions are supposed to call each other. Plotting the data was not too difficult, and after a few functions I got the hang of it. However, there were a few functions that did not require a lot of work, and were quite simple, such as the median, mean, and Euclidean distance, and standard deviation formulas. While these were fairly simple to implement, they all call on the Normalise data function, which proved to be difficult initially.

In order to complete this project before the deadline, 1-2 functions were completed daily. This was the schedule I followed to finish the project by the deadline.

Additional Thoughts:
The instructions for the assignment were clear, it is just a matter of understanding the concepts. I have asked for help whenever I felt it was needed. Additionally, I am incredibly interested in data science, and this is an introduction to the emerging field. The application of statistics to solve real world problems fascinates me, which is why I gravitated to this project.

This project has given me an unprecedented insight into programming, beyond the homework assignments that we were given this semester. This Automatic iris classification project encompasses and implements most everything that we have learned in this semester, and solidifies important concepts.  

Computer science does not come easy to me; I am not by any means a coding genius, and it takes me a few hours to grasp simple concepts. Regardless, I am proud of the progress that I have made from the beginning of the semester, and this project is helping me to further expand my knowledge. I am glad we were given this opportunity to implement the concepts that we learned this semester.

In terms of adding my own twist to the project, I added a legend box, as well as well as a heading for the box. I attempted to add a toggle switch to the “plot_data” function, however I ran in to some difficulties with Tkinter callbacks, exceptions, and required positional arguments.
